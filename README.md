# QVAULT-V2

Grant Proposal: QVAULT V2
Requested Amount: 12.5 billion QUBIC
ID : AVXAJKOXPJJYPGKJSRAOSSCOXSNAYLQZPKKUFBDZFFHCYZPBROWKFGRCQCUL
Purpose: To further decentralize Qubic Capital by developing a robust voting platform integrated with QVAULT, enhancing its smart contract, and creating a user-friendly Dapp for $QCAP holders.

UPDATE ON OUR FIRST GRANT
In October 2024, Qubic Capital requested 5.5 billion QUBIC to implement the first phase of QVAULT. Below are the milestones we achieved:

- Burnt 37 billion QUBIC: This was accomplished during QVAULT IPO, contributing to QUBIC’s deflationary mechanism.
- Sold nearly 1,200,000 $QCAP: This brings the total valuation of $QCAP to over 300 billion QUBIC.
- Provided portfolio diversification: Holders now benefit from access to assets such as 38 Quottery, 37 Random, 9 QX, 20 MLM, 244 QVAULT, and various MLM assets and mining equipment.
- Grew our community: Qubic Capital now boasts over 500 members in our Discord and more than 2,000 followers on X.

With upcoming smart contract IPOs, Qubic Capital anticipates burning hundreds of billions of QUBIC, further aligning with the deflationary vision championed by Come-from-Beyond (CfB).

PROPOSAL: QVAULT V2
Objective: To further decentralize Qubic Capital by creating a robust voting platform integrated with the QVAULT smart contract, empowering both small and large $QCAP holders, and promoting passive income through smart contract fees.

CURRENT LIMITATIONS
Currently, decisions are made through Discord voting, managed manually by the team. This system, while functional, is not scalable and limits the decentralized vision of Qubic Capital.

FEATURES OF QVAULT V2
Here’s a brief overview of the new features that will be introduced in QVAULT V2:

Voting Platform:
- How voting will work: $QCAP holders will vote on key decisions such as revenue redistribution percentages or investment amounts for IPOs.
- Autonomous execution: Once a proposal is approved, QVAULT will execute decisions automatically, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

Revenue Allocation Adjustments:
- Holders can adjust revenue allocation (e.g., reinvestment, distribution, or burning).

Asset Marketplace:
- Users will be able to sell their assets (e.g., SC shares) directly to Qubic Capital in exchange for QUBIC or $QCAP.

- QX Integration: To avoid conflicts, the marketplace will be designed to work in harmony with QX, leveraging its capabilities for seamless functionality.

Fundraising Capabilities:
- Users can purchase newly issued $QCAP directly from Qubic Capital through the Dapp.

Enhanced Metrics:
- Display ongoing proposals, voting results, circulating supply, yield, and other critical data.

Qearn Integration:
- Qubic Capital will lock a portion of its Qubic inside Qearn. We anticipate billions of $QUBIC being locked for a full year, with no option for early unlocking.

Proposal Creation Fees:
- A dynamic fee will be charged for every proposal created, initially set at 10M QUBIC to discourage spam and ensure quality proposals.
- Adjustable Fee: QVAULT shareholders will have the ability to adjust the fee as needed, balancing spam prevention and proposal accessibility.

DEVELOPER INFORMATION
The QVAULT smart contract will be updated by Poly, who previously developed Qearn and the first version of QVAULT. With proven expertise in smart contract development, Poly’s involvement ensures technical success. We expect the project to be completed in 15 weeks.

SPENDING PLAN
The requested 12.5 billion QUBIC will be allocated as follows:
- Smart Contract Update: To enhance QVAULT’s features and integrate the voting platform.
- Dapp Development: To provide $QCAP holders with seamless access to voting and other functionalities.
- Contingency Reserve: To ensure smooth execution and handle any unforeseen challenges.

Wolf will oversee the allocation of funds to ensure accountability and transparency.

CONCLUSION
Funding QVAULT V2 will empower both small and large $QCAP holders, enabling true decentralization and improving passive income opportunities through smart contract fees. By supporting this grant, you will help realize the vision of a fully decentralized Qubic Capital while contributing to the broader success of the QUBIC ecosystem.
Thank you for your support!
